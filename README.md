This is my own osu! skin, self made with guides on YouTube lul.

Various elements have been taken from Vaxei and idke's skins.

Playlist of guides I used: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwC6eYayKGMhkvkSGACRSblJqYmV7_9ZI

Theme: trying to be as minimal as possible

All files are done in GIMP, font for everything would be Noto Sans CJK JP.
